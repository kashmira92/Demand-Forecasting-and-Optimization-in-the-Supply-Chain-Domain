## Project Overview
In this project, demand forecasting and optimization were implemented using machine learning and statistical analysis techniques. The goal was to improve inventory planning and supply chain management by providing accurate sales forecasting.

## Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering: Engineered over 200 features, including lagged variables, hypothesis testing, and moving averages, to enhance the performance of the sales forecasting model.

## Model Optimization
Model Optimization: Utilized randomized search CV to optimize the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model, achieving boosted performance on over 10 million records.
## Fine-Tuning and Results
Fine-Tuning: Applied early stopping and reduced the number of features to 89 for the model. This fine-tuning resulted in a 12% SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error), significantly improving inventory planning.
